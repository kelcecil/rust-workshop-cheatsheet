# rust-workshop-cheatsheet
PDF cheat sheet intended to be a helpful handouts at Rust workshops

## Purpose

The biggest surprise of a conference or workshop can sometimes be the quality of the wifi. A student sometimes doesn't *quite* remember the syntax from your last slide and would just benefit from seeing a quick example. This document was originally conceived as part of a handout for my Rust Belt Rust workshop "Hey! There's OCaml in My Rust!", but I thought may be helpful for other speakers and educators when teaching Rust. Feel free to use this document as a handout for your own talks and workshops.
